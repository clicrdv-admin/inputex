this is a note page for highlighting important information about YUI3 for inputEx development. See the content for
what it is intended to cover.


1. inputEx.cn
    YUI3 has a create node API, e.g.
        Y.Node.create('<div id="abc">content</div>')

2. Use of Logger
  - log level:
        error   use in try-catch
        warn
        info    when to use info log?
        debug   when to use debug log?

  - use 'inputEx' as namespace

  - use JSON.stringify to show full information about an object
    Y.JSON.stringify(this)

  - include the method name in the log
    - JavaScript doesn't provide stacktrace, and line number that associate with a log message is not necessarily available
        e.g.
        Y.log('initializer() - ' + this + ' is initialized', 'debug', 'inputEx');

  - use FF3 console or trigger a Logview with a bookmarklet to avoid include logviewer code in the page.

3. base
    - base has a 'name' attribute by default.

4. Attribute
    - set at: Field.ATTRS
    - support default value, validation,
    - read: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/attribute/

5. Event
    - at constructor: this.publish("CustomObject:testEvent");
    - use 'field:rendered', 'form:xxxEvent'   (see if we need 'group', 'group' is less commonly known concept)
    - field0.on('rendered', function(args){} )
    - this.fire('field:rendered')

    - this.fire('field:updated', null, 'newVal', 'oldVal'); // use the null
      to workaround http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2151030&group_id=165715&atid=836476

6. Docs
    - follow the standard at Field.js
    - all attribute shall be docs
    - if a description has nothing meaning, e.g. "this is a field", just skip the comment line, write sth meaningful



General YUI/JavaScript notes:
  - use doctype, YUI may behave differently with different doctype 
    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

    see: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/yui3/message/71

To report to YUI3 team:
  - [docs]  YUI.add() doc missed the required argument.
     YUI add ( name , namespace , fn , version )

  - ATTRS / getAtts()?


Naming conventions

 - *Div
    - refer to div element
    - all wrapper div are *Div (but not all *Div are wrapper div)
 - *Field, *Group, *Form
    - field, group, or form instance (i.e. xxx instanceof Y.inputEx.Field)
 - el
    - refer to a YUI Node
    - 'el' without any prefix or suffix refers to the top level node of the current type
    - global id is associated to the el.
    - elClass attribute is attached to the el.
 - inputEl
    - the node of the input element
 - fieldEl, groupEl, and formEl
    - depends on whether a div wrapper is used, the elements may refer to:
    - formEl - refer to the YUI Node of the wrapper or the <form>
    - groupEl - refer to the YUI Node of the wrapper div of the fieldset of the group element (TBC)
    - fieldEl - refer to the wrapper of the inputEl ?! TBC
