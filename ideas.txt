These are some ideas generated during the development. none of them will be implement in order to make the YUI3 version
compatiable to the previous version.

 - use a renderer,componentRenderer to render content
   render(){
        Y.bind( this.get('renderer').render, this)()
        // check the correct syntax. the point is to bind this to the renderer,
        // so a new field may not necessarily need to create a class
        // a default template renderer to be provided
   }
