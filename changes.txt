log changes to annouce to users about the update


1. need to call .render() now

2. attributes may have changed. check docs for every field. :-)
    - some attributes require correct sequence:
        - put 'name' as the first attribute if you want to use it to as element id
        - if both parentEl and el are specified, parentEl shall go first in order to put the el under parentEl

    - support more options:
        instead providing a parentEl

3. fluent API
    - most methods are now return the field instance to support chaining
    - in general, except getter, the other method are likely to support chaining
