log changes to annouce to users about the update


1. need to call .render() now

2. attributes may have changed. check docs for every field. :-)
    - some attributes require correct sequence:
        - put 'name' as the first attribute if you want to use it to as element id
        - if both parentEl and el are specified, parentEl shall go first in order to put the el under parentEl

    - support more options:
        instead providing a parentEl

3. fluent API
    - most methods are now return the field instance to support chaining
    - in general, except getter, the other method are likely to support chaining
    
4. Some public methods are made private as _xxx: function(){}

5. for YUI3, all HTMLElement are wrapped by a Y.Node, you don't directly use any HTMLElement

6. *** In inputEx-YUI2, there are 'el' and 'divEl',
    - el refer to the field element, such as <input ... >
    - divEl refer to the top level div wrapper

    in inputEx-YUI3, 'el' is mistakenly translated to the top level div element!!! instead of the field element
    TODO: review the naming

     - a getField() method is provided to get the Field node if available.


7. inputEx.cn and sn are removed for Y.Node.create()
    - sn is perhaps still needed
